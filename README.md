# dotfiles

## Installation
This repo contains a shell script which installs my build of dwm, dwmblocks, dmenu, st and surf. It also copies all of the dotfiles to their respective locations. 

Arch based systems:
```
curl -s https://gitlab.com/misobarisic/dotfiles/-/raw/master/.scripts/install-arch.sh | bash
```
**NOTE** This script also installs a few additional programs. If you wish to only install my builds of suckless' software and use my dotfiles. Refer to `Others`.


Others :
```
curl -s https://gitlab.com/misobarisic/dotfiles/-/raw/master/.scripts/install.sh | bash
```

## Shell config files
Bash, fish and zsh config files share the same aliases and are generated by running `.scripts/shell-config/generate.sh`.
These config files are also generated and placed in their respective places inside this repo thanks to the git pre-commit hook.
