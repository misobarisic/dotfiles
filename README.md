# dotfiles

## Installation
This repo contains a shell script which installs my build of dwm, dwmblocks, dmenu, st and surf. It also copies all of the dotfiles to their respective locations. The script does not install the expected fonts which are JetBrains Mono, Hack and FontAwesome Icons. You may install them manually.  

Just run
```
curl -s https://gitlab.com/misobarisic/dotfiles/~/raw/master/.scripts/install.sh | bash
```

## Shell config files
Bash, fish and zsh config files share the same aliases and are generated by running `.scripts/shell-config/generate.sh`.
These config files are also generated and placed in their respective places inside this repo thanks to the git pre-commit hook.
